♻️ REVERSE SHELL EXPLEIN
What is a reverse shell?
A shell is a remotely connected terminal with another that allows you to execute commands remotely on a server. This is useful in different scenarios, but above all, it can be exploited by an attacker to steal sensitive information or run malicious tasks on a system.


A reverse shell refers to a process in which the victim's machine connects to the attacker's to receive commands. It is an efficient technique, since it evades firewalls and security filters of the traffic that enters the computer. For this reason, attackers often use these types of shells and it is also recommended to do so in penetration tests.
